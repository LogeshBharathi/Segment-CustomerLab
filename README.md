# Save Segment - React Application

This React application allows users to create and save segments dynamically by selecting various schemas, such as first name, last name, gender, etc. The user can add multiple schemas, enter a segment name, and save the segment data to a server using a webhook.

## Features

1. **Save Segment Button**: A button labeled "Save segment" is available on the main page.
2. **Popup on Click**: 
   - Clicking the "Save segment" button opens a popup.
   - The popup contains:
     - A text box for entering the segment name.
     - A dropdown labeled "Add schema to segment" with schema options:
       - First Name, Last Name, Gender, Age, Account Name, City, State.
3. **Dynamic Schema Addition**:
   - Users can click the "+Add new schema" link to add more schemas.
   - Each schema selected is added to the popup, and unselected options remain available for future selections.
4. **Submit Data**:
   - After adding schemas, clicking "Save segment" sends the segment data to the server in the format below:
     ```json
     {
       "segment_name": "segment_name_here",
       "schema": [
         {"first_name": "First Name"},
         {"last_name": "Last Name"}
       ]
     }
     ```
   - The server endpoint is provided by [webhook.site](https://webhook.site/).

## API Integration

- The app uses a MockAPI URL generated by [MockAPI](https://66e17e20c831c8811b553209.mockapi.io/api/v1/segments) to send segment data.
- Data is sent in the following format:
  ```json
  {
    "segment_name": "your_segment_name",
    "schema": [
      {"first_name": "First Name"},
      {"last_name": "Last Name"}
    ]
  }
  ```
